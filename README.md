<h3>Understanding the problems</h3>
Many students find it troublesome to search through many different websites. Some are choosy when finding an internship and some are too lazy. Therefore, they need us to help them so that they can view all the available computer science jobs as fast as possible.

<h3>Project objective</h3>
The objective of our project is to ensure students can easily search for many computer science related jobs while being lazy or maybe they have other priorities.

<h3>Introducing SoupBowl</h3>
A system that compiles job opportunities available from three different popular websites, which is JobStreet, Jora and of course Ricebowl.

<h3>How to Run</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Install Live Server Extension in Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>Run the python script main.py</li>
  <li>Open QuickHack.html file with Live Server</li>
  <li>Press Load Data</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
It doesn't have any drawbacks. Except in this prototype, the link doesnâ€™t work, yet.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
We believe that this system will greatly benefit every lazy student. Therefore, we think that our system will be a major breakthrough on how students find jobs in the future.
